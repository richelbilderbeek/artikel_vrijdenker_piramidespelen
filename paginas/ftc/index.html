<p>Businesses that involve selling products to family and friends and recruiting
other people to do the same are called multi-level marketing (MLM), network
marketing, or direct marketing businesses. Some MLMs are illegal pyramid
schemes. Before joining an MLM program, here are some things to know.</p>
<ul>
<li>What Are MLMs and How Do They Work?</li>
<li>What's a Pyramid Scheme and How Do You Spot One?</li>
<li>Is an MLM Right for You?</li>
</ul>

<p>MLM companies sell their products or services through person-to-person sales.
That means you're selling directly to other people, maybe from your home, a
customer's home, or online.</p>
<p>If you join an MLM program, the company may refer to you as an independent
"distributor," "participant," or "contractor." Most MLMs say you can make
money two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>by selling the MLM's products yourself to "retail" customers who are not
  involved in the MLM</li>
<li>by recruiting new distributors and earning commissions based on what they
  buy and their sales to retail customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Your recruits, the people they recruit, and so on, become your sales network,
or "downline." If the MLM is not a pyramid scheme, it will pay you based on
your sales to retail customers, without having to recruit new distributors.</p>
<p>Most people who join legitimate MLMs make little or no money. Some of them lose
money. In some cases, people believe they've joined a legitimate MLM, but it
turns out to be an illegal pyramid scheme that steals everything they invest
and leaves them deeply in debt.</p>
<h3 id="whats-a-pyramid-scheme-and-how-do-you-spot-one">What's a Pyramid Scheme, and How Do You Spot One?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-a-pyramid-scheme-and-how-do-you-spot-one" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Pyramid schemes are scams. They can look remarkably like legitimate MLM
business opportunities and often sell actual products, maybe even ones you've
heard of. But if you become a distributor for a pyramid scheme, it can cost
you and your recruits — often your family and friends — a lot of time and money
that you won't get back.</p>
<p>The promoters of a pyramid scheme may try to recruit you with pitches about
what you'll earn. They may say you can change your life — quit your job and
even get rich — by selling the company's products. That's a lie. Your income
would be based mostly on how many people you recruit, not how much product you
sell. Pyramid schemes are set up to encourage everyone to keep recruiting
people to keep a constant stream of new distributors — and their money —
flowing into the business.</p>
<p>Often in a pyramid scheme, you'll be encouraged or even required to buy a
certain amount of product at regular intervals, even if you already have more
inventory than you can use or sell.</p>
<p>You may even have to buy products before you're eligible to be paid or get
certain bonuses. You also may have to pay repeated fees for other items,
like training sessions or expensive marketing materials. In addition, the
company may say you can earn lavish rewards, like prizes, bonuses, exotic
vacations, and luxury cars. However, it often turns out that you have to meet
certain product purchase, recruitment, training, or other goals to qualify
for the rewards, and only a handful of distributors ever qualify.</p>
<p>Eventually, most distributors find that no matter how hard they work, they
can't sell enough inventory or recruit enough people to make money. They also
can't keep up with required fees or the inventory purchases they need to make
to qualify for rewards, and they can't earn enough money to cover their
expenses. In the end, most people run out of money, have to quit, and lose
everything they invested.</p>
<p>Here are some warning signs of a pyramid scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promoters make extravagant promises about your earning potential. Stop.
  These promises are false.</li>
<li>Promoters emphasize recruiting new distributors for your sales network as the
  real way to make money. Walk away. In a legitimate MLM program, you should be
  able to make money just by selling the product.</li>
<li>Promoters play on your emotions or use high-pressure sales tactics, maybe
  saying you'll lose the opportunity if you don't act now and discouraging you
  from taking time to study the company. Leave by the nearest exit. Any company
  that tries to pressure you to join is one to avoid.</li>
<li>Distributors buy more products than they want to use or can resell, just to
  stay active in the company or to qualify for bonuses or other rewards. If
  you see this happening, keep your money.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're considering joining an MLM, know that some MLMs — even ones that
aren't pyramid schemes — may not be a wise investment. Other MLMs may not be a
good fit for your interests and lifestyle. Here are some tips to help protect
yourself against a bad MLM experience.</p>
<h4 id="ask-yourself-these-questions">Ask yourself these questions<a class="headerlink" href="#ask-yourself-these-questions" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to be a salesperson? If you join an MLM, you'll be a salesperson.
  Your job will be to sell the company's product and, in many cases, to
  convince other people to join, invest, and sell. If you don't like selling,
  or if you're uncomfortable asking people you know to put their time and
  money into a business venture, joining an MLM is a bad idea.</li>
<li>Do you have a solid sales plan? Consider whether you have friends and family
  who will buy this product from you over and over again. Think about how you
  would find and keep other regular customers. Can people buy something like
  this product elsewhere, maybe for less?</li>
<li>What are your income goals? You might think that, with your willingness to
  work hard, you can earn substantial income through the MLM. In fact,
  most people who join MLMs and work hard make little or no money, and some of
  them lose money.</li>
<li>Can you afford to risk the money and time? Every business venture has risks.
  MLMs are no different. Even if the start-up costs seem low, additional
  expenses can add up quickly. Expenses can include training and travel
  costs, website fees, promotional materials, costs to host parties, and
  costs to buy products. If you need to borrow money or use your credit card
  to finance your expenses, you may face hefty interest charges too. Also,
  consider the time demands of the business, like going to training, recruiting
  new distributors, managing paperwork, recording inventory, and shipping
  products.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="do-your-homework">Do your homework<a class="headerlink" href="#do-your-homework" title="Anchor link to this section for reference">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Research the company. Search online for the name of the company and words
  like "review," "scam," or "complaint." You may also want to look for
  articles about the company in newspapers, magazines, or online. Does the
  company have a good reputation for customer satisfaction? Check with your
  state attorney general for complaints. A lack of complaints doesn't guarantee
  that a company is legitimate, but complaints can tip you off to possible
  problems.</li>
<li>Research what distributors are saying. Individual distributors often post
  their own training videos online to promote the MLM. Search for these
  materials. Be suspicious if the trainings make earnings claims, tell you
  that the fastest way to make money is to "recruit, recruit, recruit," or
  suggest that all you need to do to build a downline is "find two people who
  find two people." Claims like these are hallmarks of a pyramid scheme.</li>
<li>Consider the products. MLM companies may sell quality items at competitive
  prices. But some offer goods that are overpriced, have questionable
  benefits, or are downright unsafe to use. For example, be very skeptical
  about health products advertised as having "miracle" ingredients or
  guaranteed results. Those claims are generally false or at least unproven
  and, at worst, the products could be dangerous.</li>
<li>Understand the costs. Many MLMs make you buy training or marketing materials,
  or pay for seminars on building your business. You may need to book travel
  and pay for hotels and meals. Make sure you know what you must pay for, and
  how much it will cost over time. If the company says some of these
  things — like periodic product purchases or training — are optional, find out
  if you'll become ineligible for bonuses or rewards if you opt out of them.</li>
<li>Ask about refunds. In many MLMs, before you can start selling the products,
  you have to buy them from the company. So get the company's refund policy in
  writing. Make sure it includes information about returning any unused
  products, including restrictions and penalties. Consider whether you'll get
  a full refund or only a partial one — and how long it may take.</li>
<li>Read the paperwork and have a friend or advisor review it. Read the company's
  sales literature, business plan, disclosure documents, and any contracts or
  agreements you'll need to sign. Ask an accountant, a lawyer, or someone else
  you trust — and who is not affiliated with the company — to help you review
  the MLM's materials. Ask them to look at your possible earnings and whether
  the company can back up its claims about how much money you can make. Ask
  for their honest opinion about whether they think the MLM is legitimate and a
  good fit for you.</li>

<p>Ask tough questions and dig for details. Don't consider it nosy or intrusive.
You're thinking about starting a small business. A good businessperson
needs those answers. Here are some questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long have you been in the MLM?</li>
<li>How much money did you make last year, after expenses?</li>
<li>What were your expenses last year?</li>
<li>Have you borrowed money or used your credit card to fund your business?
  How much did you borrow? How much do you owe?</li>
<li>Do you need to have recruits to make money?</li>
<li>How many people have you recruited? How many did you recruit last year?</li>
<li>How many of your recruits have left the business?</li>
<li>What percentage of the money you made came from selling
  the product to customers outside the MLM?</li>
<li>What percentage of the money you made — income and bonuses less your
  expenses — came from recruiting other distributors and selling them
  inventory or other items to get started?</li>
<li>How much time do you spend on the business?</li>
<li>How much inventory did you buy from the MLM last year?
  Did you sell all of your inventory?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you're on a mission to check out a potential business deal that
will require your time and money. The information you learn can help you
decide whether it's really a deal, a dud, or straight up illegal.</p>
